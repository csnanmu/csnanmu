        "\n",
        "Predicting molecular properties is a critical yet challenging aspect of drug discovery, hindered significantly by the scarcity of labeled data, which typically comes from costly and time-consuming laboratory experiments. Current models are often inadequate in settings where labeled data is minimal, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where the model must perform tasks using natural language instructions without prior specific training. This challenge is compounded by the limitations of existing models that struggle to effectively integrate complex instructions with the intricate details of molecular graphs.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper presents GIMLET, an innovative model that integrates natural language instructions with molecular graph data to predict molecular properties, thereby minimizing the reliance on extensive labeled datasets. By leveraging a pretraining strategy on a diverse dataset that includes both molecular tasks and corresponding instructions, GIMLET facilitates zero-shot learning, enabling it to predict properties of new molecules without direct prior exposure. This approach not only addresses the issue of data scarcity but also streamlines the process of drug discovery and chemical analysis, offering a more efficient pathway through the use of enriched natural language processing and graph analysis techniques.\n"
